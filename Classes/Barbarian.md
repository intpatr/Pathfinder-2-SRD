# Barbarian
> Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in carving through your enemies
using powerful weapons and wreaking havoc, relying on astonishing
durability, without needing complicated techniques or rigid training.
You associate your rage with a traditional symbol of affinity known
as a totem, which might take the form of an animal, a spirit, or a part
of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every
problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the dark
emotions inside them and release them only when it matters most.
