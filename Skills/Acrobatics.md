# Acrobatics (Dexterity)
> Acrobatics measures your ability to perform physical feats
that require balance, coordination, and grace.

## Untrained Uses

### Balance (1 Action)
>Descriptors: Move

You can move across a narrow surface or uneven
ground by attempting an Acrobatics check against the DC of the
narrow surface or uneven ground. You start this action while
in a square that contains a narrow surface, uneven ground, or
another similar feature. You are always flat-footed while on a
narrow surface or uneven ground.

### Escape (1 Action)
When trying to escape from restraints or a creature’s Grapple,
attempt an Acrobatics check. If you’re tied up by a creature, the
escape DC is that creature’s Thievery DC. If you’re restrained
by manacles or some other device, the DC is based on the type
of restraint. Against a Grapple, the escape DC is the Grappling
creature’s Athletics DC.
- **Success:** You escape from the restraints or the Grapple, losing
the grabbed or restrained condition.
- **Critical Success:** Per a success, and you can move up to 5 feet.
If you move, this action gains the move trait.
- **Critical Failure:** You don’t escape, and you take a –2
circumstance penalty to Acrobatics checks to Escape until
the end of your current turn.

### Grab Edge (Reaction)
>Descriptors: Manipulate

>Trigger: You fall from or past an edge or handhold

>Requirements: Your hands are not tied behind your back or otherwise restrained

When you fall off an edge or past an edge or some other form
of handhold, you can use this reaction in an attempt to grab it,
potentially stopping your fall. If you grab on, you can then Climb
up using Athletics.
- **Success:** If you have at least one hand free, you grab on to
the edge or the handhold, stopping your fall. You still take
damage from the distance fallen so far, but you treat the fall
as though you had fallen 20 feet fewer. If you have no hands
free, you continue to fall as if you had failed the check.
- **Critical Success:** You grab on to the edge or the handhold,
whether or not you have a hand free, typically by using a
suitable held item to catch yourself (catching a battle axe
on a ledge, for example). You still take damage from the
distance fallen so far, but you treat the fall as though you
had fallen 30 feet fewer.
- **Critical Failure:** You continue to fall, and if you’ve fallen 20 feet
or more before you use this reaction, you take 10 bludgeoning
damage from the impact for every 20 feet fallen.
